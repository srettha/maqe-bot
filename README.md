# MAQE Bot

This is my interpretation of how to solve MAQE Bot challenge from [MAQE challenge](http://maqe.github.io/maqe-bot.html).

The goal of this bot is to return `X`, `Y`, and `Direction` that bot is facing.

e.g.

```bash
RW15RW1
```

with the given input, what is answer of those steps?

```javascript
{
    X: 15,
    Y: -1,
    Direction: 'South',
}
```
